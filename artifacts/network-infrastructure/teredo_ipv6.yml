details:
  what: |
    IPv6 transition technology configuration managing Teredo tunneling, 6to4 automatic tunneling,
    ISATAP (Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol), and IP-HTTPS settings. Enables
    IPv6 connectivity over IPv4 networks through tunnel server addresses and interface parameters.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for detecting covert communication channels that exploit IPv6 transition technologies
    to bypass firewall restrictions and network monitoring. Teredo and other tunneling protocols
    can be abused for command and control communication, data exfiltration, and firewall evasion.
    Configuration changes may indicate sophisticated attack techniques using IPv6 tunnels.

  structure: |
    Teredo configuration includes Type (client/server mode), ServerName (tunnel server address),
    ClientPort (client communication port), and EnabledState (service status). IPv6 parameters
    control DisabledComponents (IPv6 feature disabling) and transition technology settings.

  examples:
    - "Teredo\\Type: 4 (Teredo client mode)"
    - "Teredo\\ServerName: teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com (Default Microsoft server)"
    - "Teredo\\ClientPort: 0 (Dynamic port allocation)"
    - "DisabledComponents: 0xFF (IPv6 completely disabled)"
    - "6to4\\Enabled: 1 (6to4 automatic tunneling enabled)"
    - "ISATAP\\Enabled: 1 (ISATAP tunneling enabled)"
    - "IPHTTPS\\State: 3 (IP-HTTPS enabled and active)"
    - "Teredo\\ServerName: malicious-tunnel.evil.com (Suspicious server)"

limitations:
  - "Configuration settings do NOT prove IPv6 tunneling was actually used"
  - "Enabled transition technologies don't indicate actual tunnel establishment"
  - "Server settings don't prove successful connections to tunnel servers"
  - "IPv6 enablement doesn't show what traffic used IPv6 tunnels"
  - "Teredo configuration may exist without any tunnel communication"
  - "Disabled components don't prevent all IPv6 transition technology usage"
  - "Tunnel server addresses can be legitimate while still enabling covert channels"
