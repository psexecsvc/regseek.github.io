details:
  what: |
    Windows proxy configuration including server addresses, ports, Proxy Auto-Configuration 
    (PAC) files, bypass lists, and automatic detection settings. Controls how browsers and 
    system internet connections route through proxy servers for filtering and monitoring.

  forensic_value: |
    Reveals proxy configurations that may indicate data exfiltration routes, malicious proxy 
    servers for traffic interception, or network evasion techniques. Critical for understanding 
    network communication paths and identifying unauthorized routing that could facilitate data theft.

  structure: |
    Settings include ProxyEnable (DWORD), ProxyServer (REG_SZ address:port), ProxyOverride 
    (bypass list), AutoConfigURL (PAC file location), and binary DefaultConnectionSettings 
    containing detailed proxy configurations and authentication data.

  examples:
    - "ProxyEnable: 1 (proxy enabled)"
    - "ProxyServer: 192.168.1.100:8080"
    - "ProxyOverride: localhost;127.*;10.*;192.168.*;*.company.com"
    - "AutoConfigURL: http://proxy.company.com/proxy.pac"
    - "AutoDetect: 1 (automatic proxy detection enabled)"
    - "ProxyServer: socks=127.0.0.1:9050 (SOCKS proxy for Tor)"
    - "ProxyServer: http=proxy.evil.com:3128;https=proxy.evil.com:3128"
    - "MigrateProxy: 1"
    - "EnableHttp1_1: 1"
    - "EnableNegotiate: 1"

limitations:
  - "Proxy configuration does NOT prove network traffic actually used the proxy"
  - "Settings can be bypassed by applications using direct connections"
  - "Configuration may be overridden by group policy or malware"
  - "PAC file URLs don't indicate the PAC file was successfully retrieved"
  - "Proxy bypass list shows intent but not actual traffic routing"
  - "Settings don't reveal what data passed through proxy servers"
  - "Automatic detection settings may fail without indication in registry"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_usage_proof:
    - "Network traffic logs showing actual connections through proxy servers"
    - "Proxy server access logs with matching client IP addresses and timestamps"
    - "DNS resolution logs showing proxy server name resolution"
    - "Application logs confirming proxy usage and authentication"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Browser history showing PAC file downloads or proxy authentication pages"
    - "Event logs showing proxy connectivity errors or authentication failures"
    - "Network interface statistics showing traffic patterns consistent with proxy usage"
    - "Firewall logs showing blocked direct connections forcing proxy usage"
