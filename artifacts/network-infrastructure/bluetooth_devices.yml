details:
  what: |
    Windows Bluetooth subsystem maintains device pairing history, connection logs, device capabilities, 
    authentication keys, and service discovery records. Tracks all Bluetooth devices that have been 
    paired, attempted connections, and supported device profiles.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating wireless data exfiltration, unauthorized device connections, and covert 
    communication channels. Shows evidence of Bluetooth keyboards, mice, phones, headsets, and potential 
    data transfer devices. Essential for insider threat investigations and establishing device presence during incidents.

  structure: |
    Device entries organized by Bluetooth MAC addresses containing device names, pairing timestamps, 
    authentication keys, supported services, device types, and connection history. Each device maintains 
    profile information, capability flags, and last seen timestamps.

  examples:
    - "Device: 00:11:22:33:44:55 (Samsung Galaxy S21 - Mobile phone)"
    - "DeviceName: AirPods Pro (Apple wireless earbuds)"
    - "LastConnected: 2024-01-20 15:30:25 UTC (Recent connection timestamp)"
    - "PairingDate: 2024-01-15 09:00:00 UTC (Initial pairing time)"
    - "DeviceType: 0x040418 (Audio/Video device - headphones)"
    - "Services: A2DP, AVRCP, HFP (Audio streaming and control)"
    - "LinkKey: [Binary authentication key data]"
    - "TrustedDevice: 1 (Device marked as trusted)"

limitations:
  - "Bluetooth pairing history does NOT prove active data transfer occurred"
  - "Device presence in registry doesn't indicate device was connected during specific timeframes"
  - "LastConnected timestamps may not reflect actual communication sessions"
  - "Pairing information persists even after device is no longer used"
  - "Authentication keys don't prove successful data transmission"
  - "Service capabilities don't show what services were actually utilized"
  - "Trusted device status doesn't indicate automatic connection occurred"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Bluetooth service logs showing actual connection establishment and data transfer"
    - "Network traffic logs showing Bluetooth protocol communication"
    - "File system artifacts showing files transferred via Bluetooth"
    - "Application logs showing Bluetooth-enabled applications activity"

    - "USB device logs showing Bluetooth adapter activity"
    - "Event logs showing device connection and disconnection events"
    - "File creation timestamps correlating with Bluetooth connection times"
