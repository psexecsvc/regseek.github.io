details:
  what: |
    DNS client configuration encompasses name resolution settings including cache behavior, 
    DNS server preferences, DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) configuration, cache size limits, negative 
    caching policies, and DNS security settings controlling system-wide name resolution.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating DNS hijacking attacks, malicious DNS server usage, DNS tunneling 
    attempts, and command and control communication through DNS protocols. DNS configuration 
    changes may indicate network-based attacks, DNS cache poisoning attempts, or DNS exfiltration techniques.

  structure: |
    DNS configuration includes MaxCacheTtl (maximum cache time), NegativeCacheTime (failed lookup caching), 
    CacheHashTableSize (cache table dimensions), EnableAutoDoh (automatic DNS-over-HTTPS), DohPolicy 
    (DoH enforcement level), and PrimaryDnsServer (preferred DNS server).

  examples:
    - "MaxCacheTtl: 604800 (7 days maximum cache retention)"
    - "NegativeCacheTime: 300 (5 minutes for failed DNS lookups)"
    - "CacheHashTableSize: 211 (DNS cache hash table size)"
    - "EnableAutoDoh: 2 (Automatic secure DNS resolution enabled)"
    - "DohPolicy: 3 (DNS-over-HTTPS required for all queries)"
    - "PrimaryDnsServer: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS - potential policy violation)"
    - "PrimaryDnsServer: 192.168.1.100 (Internal DNS server)"
    - "DnsPolicy\\\\malicious-domain.com: Block (DNS filtering policy)"

limitations:
  - "DNS configuration settings do NOT prove malicious domains were accessed"
  - "Cache settings don't indicate what DNS queries were actually made"
  - "DoH configuration doesn't show encrypted DNS queries that occurred"
  - "DNS server changes may be legitimate network administration"
  - "Policy settings don't prove DNS filtering was actively enforced"
  - "Malicious DNS servers may be configured but never used"
  - "Cache size settings don't reveal historical DNS query patterns"
