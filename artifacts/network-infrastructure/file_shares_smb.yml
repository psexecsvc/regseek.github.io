details:
  what: |
    Windows Server Message Block (SMB/CIFS) file sharing configuration including shared folder
    definitions, access permissions, security descriptors, and server parameters. Manages both
    administrative shares (C$, ADMIN$) and user-defined shares with access control settings.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating lateral movement techniques and data exfiltration through network
    shares. Shows evidence of shared folders used for data staging and reveals SMB configuration
    vulnerabilities. Essential for analyzing advanced persistent threats that leverage legitimate
    file sharing for stealth operations.

  structure: |
    Shares registry subkey contains individual share configurations with UNC paths, security
    descriptors, and access permissions. Server parameters control SMB behavior, authentication
    requirements, and security signing. Binary security descriptors define access control.

  examples:
    - "Shares\\\\ADMIN$: C:\\\\ (Hidden administrative share - full system access)"
    - "Shares\\\\C$: C:\\\\ (Hidden drive share - root filesystem access)"
    - "Shares\\\\SharedDocs: C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Documents (Public document share)"
    - "Shares\\\\Confidential: C:\\\\Sensitive\\\\Data (Custom sensitive data share)"
    - "RequireSecuritySignature: 1 (SMB signing required for security)"
    - "EnableSecuritySignature: 1 (SMB signing enabled)"
    - "NullSessionShares: COMCFG,DFS$ (Shares accessible without authentication)"
    - "RestrictNullSessAccess: 0 (Allow null session access - security risk)"

limitations:
  - "Share configuration does NOT prove files were actually accessed or transferred"
  - "Shared folder existence doesn't indicate successful network connections"
  - "Administrative shares are enabled by default and don't prove malicious usage"
  - "SMB settings don't reveal what data was shared or accessed"
  - "Security descriptors don't indicate actual permission usage"
  - "Share creation doesn't prove network clients connected"
  - "Configuration may exist without any network file sharing activity"
