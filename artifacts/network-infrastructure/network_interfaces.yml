details:
  what: |
    Windows stores network interface configuration data including IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, 
    DNS servers, DHCP settings, and adapter-specific parameters. Each network interface has its own GUID-identified 
    subkey containing current and historical network configuration.

  forensic_value: |
    Reveals network configuration history, static IP assignments, DNS server changes, and can show evidence of 
    network pivoting, tunneling, or lateral movement preparation. Critical for understanding network connectivity, 
    identifying rogue configurations, and correlating network-based attacks with system configuration.

  structure: |
    Interface GUIDs as subkeys containing REG_SZ and REG_MULTI_SZ values for network parameters. Key values include 
    IPAddress, SubnetMask, DefaultGateway, NameServer, DHCPIPAddress, DHCPServer, Domain, EnableDHCP, and lease information. 
    Binary data includes interface metrics and adapter settings.

  examples:
    - "DHCPIPAddress: 192.168.1.100"
    - "StaticAddress: 10.0.0.50"
    - "SubnetMask: 255.255.255.0"
    - "DefaultGateway: 192.168.1.1"
    - "NameServer: 8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1"
    - "DHCPServer: 192.168.1.1"
    - "Domain: company.local"
    - "DHCPLeaseObtainedTime: 1642291200 (Unix timestamp)"
    - "DHCPLeaseTerminatesTime: 1642377600 (Unix timestamp)"
    - "EnableDHCP: 1 (DHCP enabled)"
    - "MTU: 1500"
    - "Interface Metric: 20"

limitations:
  - "Network interface configuration does NOT prove network communication occurred"
  - "IP address assignments don't indicate what network traffic was generated"
  - "DNS server settings don't show what domain name queries were made"
  - "DHCP lease information doesn't prove active network usage during lease period"
  - "Static IP configuration may be set without network connectivity"
  - "Gateway settings don't indicate routing table was used for communication"
  - "Interface metrics don't show network performance or actual usage"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Network traffic logs showing actual communication using configured IP addresses"
    - "DHCP server logs showing lease assignments and renewal activity"
    - "DNS query logs showing name resolution using configured DNS servers"
    - "Routing table logs showing gateway utilization for network communication"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Network connection logs showing active interface utilization"
    - "Application logs showing network-dependent services using interfaces"
    - "Timeline analysis correlating interface changes with network activity"
