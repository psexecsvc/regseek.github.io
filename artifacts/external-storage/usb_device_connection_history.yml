details:
  what: |
    Windows maintains USB device connection history including storage devices, vendor/product identifiers, 
    serial numbers, connection timestamps, and device properties. Tracks current and historical USB 
    device connections with hardware identification and driver associations.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows complete history of USB devices connected to the system, enabling identification of specific 
    devices used in investigations. Critical for establishing device usage timelines, correlating USB 
    activity with security incidents, and identifying recurring suspicious devices.

  structure: |
    USBSTOR contains storage device entries with vendor, product, version, and unique serial numbers. 
    USB enumeration tracks all USB devices including non-storage items. Portable Devices manages 
    device-specific settings. EMDMgmt contains external device management policies.

  examples:
    - "USBSTOR\\Disk&Ven_Kingston&Prod_DataTraveler_3.0&Rev_PMAP\\001CC0EC336BD480&0"
    - "DeviceDesc: Kingston DataTraveler 3.0 USB Device"
    - "VendorID: 0951 (Kingston Technology)"
    - "ProductID: 1666 (DataTraveler series identifier)"
    - "SerialNumber: 001CC0EC336BD480 (Unique device identifier)"
    - "FirstInstallDate: 2024-01-15 09:30:25 UTC"
    - "LastArrivalDate: 2024-01-20 14:45:12 UTC"
    - "DeviceCapabilities: 0x00000084 (Removable | UniqueID)"
    - "FriendlyName: Kingston DataTraveler 3.0 (E:)"

limitations:
  - "Device connection history does NOT prove files were accessed or transferred"
  - "Connection timestamps don't indicate what data operations occurred"
  - "Device presence doesn't prove malicious activity or data exfiltration"
  - "Serial numbers can be spoofed or modified by specialized tools"
  - "Connection records may include legitimate maintenance or antivirus scanning"
  - "Multiple connections don't necessarily indicate repeated data theft"
