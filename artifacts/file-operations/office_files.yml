details:
  what: |
    Microsoft Office applications track recently opened documents, file locations, and access
    patterns across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and other Office applications. Includes
    both local and cloud-based document access tracking with file paths, network locations,
    SharePoint URLs, and OneDrive sync paths.

  forensic_value: |
    Reveals what documents users have been working on and shows access to sensitive files.
    Can indicate data theft, unauthorized document access, or intellectual property violations.
    Critical for investigations involving document tampering, data exfiltration, corporate espionage,
    and unauthorized access to confidential information.

  structure: |
    Version-specific subkeys (16.0 for Office 2016/2019/365, 15.0 for Office 2013, etc.)
    containing application-specific MRU lists. Item values contain full file paths, network
    locations, SharePoint URLs, and cloud storage paths. Binary data includes access timestamps
    and document metadata.

  examples:
    - "Word Item 1: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\Financial_Report_Q4.docx"
    - "Excel Item 2: \\\\server\\shared\\HR\\Salary_Data_2024.xlsx"
    - "PowerPoint Item 3: https://company.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing/presentation.pptx"
    - "OneDrive: https://d.docs.live.net/abc123/Documents/strategy.docx"
    - "Place MRU: C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\Confidential"
    - "Trusted Document: C:\\Downloads\\suspicious_macro.xlsm"
    - "Access Time: [Binary FILETIME: 132876543210000000]"
    - "Network Share: \\\\fileserver.company.com\\finance\\budget.xlsx"
    - "USB Document: E:\\USB_Drive\\sensitive_data.docx"

limitations:
  - "Recent file lists do NOT prove documents were actually edited or modified"
  - "File paths don't indicate successful document opening or content access"
  - "Network locations don't prove successful authentication or file retrieval"
  - "SharePoint URLs don't show document was downloaded or edited locally"
  - "Trusted document settings don't indicate macros were executed"
  - "Access timestamps may reflect failed opening attempts or preview actions"
  - "Cloud storage paths don't prove synchronization or actual document access"
