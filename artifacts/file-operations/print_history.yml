details:
  what: |
    Windows print subsystem maintains comprehensive printer configurations including installed
    printers, network printer connections, print settings, driver information, and user-specific
    printer preferences. Manages local and network printer access and print spooler service
    behavior for complete printing infrastructure management.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data exfiltration through physical document printing and
    intellectual property theft. Shows what documents were printed, which printers were accessed,
    and network printer usage patterns. Essential for insider threat investigations involving
    document theft and corporate espionage through print channels.

  structure: |
    Printer configurations stored as printer name subkeys containing driver information, port
    assignments, device settings, and security descriptors. User settings include default
    printer selections and device modes. Network printer connections show authentication
    and access patterns with connection timestamps.

limitations:
  - "Printer configuration does NOT prove documents were actually printed"
  - "Installed printer drivers don't indicate successful print job completion"
  - "Network printer connections don't show actual document output"
  - "Default printer settings don't prove printer usage or document access"
  - "Print processor configurations don't indicate successful print operations"
  - "Device modes don't show actual printing activity or document content"
  - "Security descriptors don't prove print job authorization or access"
