details:
  what: |
    Windows tracks files and folders accessed through standard Open and Save dialog boxes
    used by most Windows applications. Maintains separate lists organized by file extension
    and includes folder navigation history within dialogs. Captures user file interaction
    patterns across applications regardless of the specific application used.

  forensic_value: |
    Reveals comprehensive user file access patterns, document locations, network share usage,
    and specific files opened for editing, viewing, or saving. Shows evidence of data access,
    document tampering, unauthorized file operations, and can indicate data staging for
    exfiltration. Critical for proving user interaction with specific files.

  structure: |
    Organized by file extensions (*.*, txt, pdf, docx, etc.) with MRUListEx showing access
    order within each category. Binary data contains full file paths, folder locations, and
    shell item lists. OpenSavePidlMRU uses PIDL format for richer location data including
    network paths and special folders.

  examples:
    - "Extension: *.*\\0: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\confidential.pdf"
    - "Extension: txt\\1: C:\\Temp\\passwords.txt"
    - "Extension: xlsx\\2: \\\\server\\finance\\budget2024.xlsx"
    - "Extension: exe\\0: D:\\USB\\suspicious_tool.exe"
    - "Extension: zip\\1: C:\\Downloads\\data_archive.zip"
    - "MRUListEx: 2,1,0 (most recent order within extension)"
    - "Network path: \\\\192.168.1.100\\shared\\sensitive_data.docx"
    - "Special folder: Desktop\\document.pdf"

limitations:
  - "Dialog history does NOT prove files were actually opened, edited, or saved"
  - "File paths don't indicate successful file operations or content access"
  - "Network locations don't prove successful authentication or file retrieval"
  - "MRU entries may reflect browsing or failed file operations"
  - "Extension-based organization doesn't show actual file content or type"
  - "Dialog usage doesn't indicate duration of file interaction or editing"
  - "PIDL data may reference non-existent or moved files"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_file_access_proof:
    - "File system timestamps showing actual file modifications or access"
    - "Application event logs showing successful file opening and editing operations"
    - "Process execution logs showing applications performing file operations"
    - "File content analysis showing changes consistent with user interaction"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents showing files accessed through these dialog boxes"
    - "LastVisitedPidlMRU showing folder navigation correlating with file access"
    - "Office MRU entries showing document access patterns matching OpenSave history"
    - "Jump Lists showing application usage correlating with file dialog interactions"
