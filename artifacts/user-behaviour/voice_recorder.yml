details:
  what: |
    Windows Voice Recorder application stores configuration data including recording quality
    settings, file save locations, application preferences, and usage statistics. Registry
    tracks app positioning, window states, recently used settings, and integration preferences
    for audio recording functionality built into Windows.

  forensic_value: |
    Provides evidence of audio recording activity that could indicate surveillance, interview
    recording, voice memo creation, or audio evidence capture. Shows usage patterns, recording
    preferences, and potential evidence of covert recording activities. Can reveal user behavior
    related to audio documentation or evidence preservation.

  structure: |
    SoundRecorder entries include recording quality preferences, default save locations,
    application window positioning, and recent file access patterns. ApplicationFrame data
    tracks window positions and application state information. UWP app registration contains
    installation and permission data.

  examples:
    - "LastOpenedFile: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\Recording.m4a"
    - "RecordingQuality: High (Audio quality preference)"
    - "DefaultSaveLocation: Documents\\Recordings"
    - "AutoSave: 1 (Automatic file saving enabled)"
    - "AppPosition: {x:100, y:100, width:800, height:600}"

limitations:
  - "Voice Recorder configuration does NOT prove audio recordings were actually made"
  - "Quality settings don't indicate successful recording operations occurred"
  - "Save locations don't show audio files were created or stored"
  - "Application positioning doesn't prove the app was actively used"
  - "Recent file entries don't indicate recordings were played or accessed"
  - "Auto-save settings don't show automatic recording functionality was used"
  - "Permission data doesn't prove microphone access was granted or used"

  strengthens_evidence:
