details:
  what: |
    Microsoft Store and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application ecosystem including installed
    app packages, package registrations, Store configuration settings, and app container security
    configurations. Manages modern Windows application deployment, updates, and licensing.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for analyzing modern app usage patterns, identifying sideloaded applications that
    bypass Store security mechanisms, and detecting unauthorized app installations. Shows evidence
    of enterprise app deployments, developer mode enabling, and potential security bypasses through
    sideloading or app container escape techniques.

  structure: |
    Package registration data organized by package full names including publisher information,
    installation paths, and security descriptors. Store configuration includes installation
    policies and update settings. AppX deployment information contains package metadata and
    app container security configurations.

  examples:
    - "Package\\Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_10.2103.8.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe: Calculator app package"
    - "Package\\Microsoft.Photos_2023.11090.26005.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe: Photos application"
    - "PackageRepositoryRoot: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps (Store app installation directory)"
    - "Store\\InstallPromptPolicy: 1 (Prompt for app installations)"
    - "AppxAllUserStore: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps (System-wide app store)"
    - "PackageMoniker: CompanyName.SuspiciousApp_1.0.0.0_x64__1234567890abc (Sideloaded app)"
    - "DeveloperModeEnabled: 1 (Developer mode active - allows sideloading)"

limitations:
  - "App package registration does NOT prove applications were actually used or executed"
  - "Store configuration doesn't indicate successful app installations or updates"
  - "Package metadata doesn't show application launch frequency or usage patterns"
  - "Developer mode settings don't prove sideloading actually occurred"
  - "App container configurations don't indicate security bypass attempts"
  - "Installation paths don't show application execution or user interaction"
  - "Package versions don't indicate when apps were last used or accessed"
