details:
  what: |
    Windows Spotlight manages lock screen background images, suggested content, tips and tricks,
    app suggestions, and personalization features. Registry tracks user interactions with
    spotlight content, downloaded image metadata, content preferences, and engagement metrics.
    Controls automatic content updates and cloud-sourced backgrounds.

  forensic_value: |
    Reveals user behavior patterns, content interaction history, and system usage characteristics.
    Shows evidence of user engagement with system features, potential indicators of user presence
    and activity, and timeline information for system access patterns. Can indicate user
    preferences and provide context for user behavior analysis.

  structure: |
    ContentDeliveryManager contains feature enablement flags, content subscription settings,
    interaction counters, and download preferences. Lock Screen entries include image sources,
    update frequencies, and user customization preferences. Binary values track engagement
    metrics and content delivery statistics.

limitations:
  - "Spotlight configuration does NOT prove content was actually viewed or interacted with"
  - "Enabled features don't indicate user engagement or attention to spotlight content"
  - "Content subscriptions don't show content was downloaded or displayed"
  - "Lock screen settings don't prove user saw or interacted with lock screen images"
  - "App suggestions don't indicate suggested apps were installed or used"
  - "Tips and tricks settings don't show tips were read or followed"
  - "Interaction counters may reflect automatic system behavior rather than user action"
