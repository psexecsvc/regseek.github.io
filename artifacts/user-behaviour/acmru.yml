details:
  what: |
    Windows tracks application-specific Most Recently Used (MRU) items including file dialog
    sizing preferences, default folder locations, and stream operations. Provides granular 
    tracking of user interaction patterns with file dialogs and document access behaviors.

  forensic_value: |
    Reveals detailed user interaction patterns with applications and file systems, showing
    preferred locations for file operations and evidence of document manipulation activities.
    Critical for understanding user behavior and establishing application usage timelines.

  structure: |
    CIDSizeMRU stores dialog box sizing preferences by application executable names.
    FirstFolder maintains default folder locations for file dialogs by file type.
    StreamMRU contains data stream access patterns with binary PIDL data representing
    folder locations and navigation history.

  examples:
    - "CIDSizeMRU\\notepad.exe: Dialog size 800x600 (Notepad file dialog preferences)"
    - "CIDSizeMRU\\winword.exe: Word document dialog sizing information"
    - "FirstFolder\\*.txt: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents (Default text file location)"
    - "FirstFolder\\*.pdf: C:\\Downloads (Default PDF file location)"
    - "StreamMRU\\0: Binary PIDL data for recent stream operations"
    - "LastVisitedMRU\\exe files: C:\\Tools\\Utilities (Executable file access location)"
    - "MRUListEx: 2,1,0 (Access order - most recent first)"

limitations:
  - "Dialog preferences do NOT prove files were actually opened or accessed"
  - "Size settings don't indicate successful file operations or document viewing"
  - "Default folder locations don't show actual file activity in those folders"
  - "Stream operations may reflect system activity rather than user actions"
  - "PIDL data can become corrupted or reference non-existent locations"
  - "MRU entries don't indicate duration of file interaction or editing"
  - "Application-specific settings don't prove the application was actively used"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_file_access_proof:
    - "File system timestamps showing actual file modifications or access"
    - "Application event logs showing document opening and editing activity"
    - "Process execution logs confirming application usage during dialog interactions"
    - "Registry keys modified by applications during file operations"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents showing files accessed through these dialog preferences"
    - "ShellBags data showing folder navigation correlating with dialog settings"
    - "Jump Lists showing application usage patterns matching dialog history"
    - "Thumbnail cache entries showing file previews from preferred locations"
