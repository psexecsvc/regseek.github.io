details:
  what: |
    Windows activation and licensing infrastructure controls activation status verification, 
    product key management, Key Management Service (KMS) configuration, digital entitlement 
    validation, and Software Protection Platform settings for license enforcement.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for system identification, compliance verification, and detecting unauthorized 
    or pirated Windows installations. Shows activation bypass attempts, KMS server redirection 
    for unauthorized activation, and license tampering correlating with security violations.

  structure: |
    Software Protection Platform contains activation tokens, license status, KMS client 
    configuration, and digital rights management data. OOBE settings control initial setup 
    behavior. WPA maintains activation state and hardware fingerprinting.

  examples:
    - "SoftwareProtectionPlatform\\ActivationStatus: 1 (Windows activated)"
    - "KMSServerName: kms.company.com (Corporate KMS server)"
    - "GracePeriodRemaining: 30 (Days remaining before activation required)"
    - "LicenseStatus: Licensed (Valid license detected)"
    - "DigitalEntitlement: 1 (Digital license linked to Microsoft account)"
    - "ProductKeyChannel: Volume:GVLK (Volume license activation)"
    - "OOBE\\MediaBootInstall: 1 (Installed from media)"
    - "ActivationMethod: KMS (Key Management Service activation)"

limitations:
  - "Activation status does NOT prove system usage patterns or security compliance"
  - "KMS server settings don't confirm actual communication or activation occurred"
  - "Licensed status may not reflect current activation state accuracy"
  - "Digital entitlement doesn't prove legitimate software acquisition"
  - "Grace period settings don't indicate when activation attempts were made"
  - "Product key information doesn't prove software was legally obtained"
  - "Activation bypass may be legitimate enterprise configuration, not piracy"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_licensing_compliance_proof:
    - "Software licensing audit logs showing legitimate acquisition"
    - "Network logs confirming KMS server communications"
    - "Purchase records or enterprise licensing agreements"
    - "System event logs showing activation service operations"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Hardware device fingerprinting correlating with licensed installations"
    - "Registry modification timestamps showing activation attempts"
    - "Network traffic logs showing activation server communications"
    - "Application logs showing licensing service operations"
