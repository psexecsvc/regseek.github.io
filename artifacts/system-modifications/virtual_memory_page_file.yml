details:
  what: |
    Virtual memory and page file configuration controls how Windows manages memory when physical 
    RAM is insufficient. Settings include page file locations, size limits, memory management 
    parameters, virtual address space configuration, and swap file behavior. Manages memory 
    allocation policies and virtual memory security settings.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for memory forensics as page files contain sensitive data including passwords, 
    encryption keys, process memory, and document contents that persist after process termination. 
    Page file security settings reveal if sensitive data clearing was disabled, enabling forensic 
    memory recovery. Configuration changes may indicate attempts to hide memory artifacts.

  structure: |
    Memory Management contains PagingFiles (page file configuration string), ClearPageFileAtShutdown 
    (security setting for data erasure), ExistingPageFiles (current active page files), SessionPoolSize 
    (session memory allocation), SystemPages (system memory configuration), and DisablePagingExecutive 
    (kernel memory paging control).

  examples:
    - "PagingFiles: C:\\\\pagefile.sys 2048 4096 (2GB initial, 4GB maximum)"
    - "ClearPageFileAtShutdown: 0 (Pagefile not cleared - potential data recovery)"
    - "ExistingPageFiles: \\\\??\\\\C:\\\\pagefile.sys (Active page file location)"
    - "SessionPoolSize: 192 (Session pool memory allocation in MB)"
    - "SystemPages: 0 (System uses default page table size)"
    - "DisablePagingExecutive: 1 (Kernel memory not paged - security enhancement)"
    - "PagingFiles: D:\\\\swap.sys 8192 16384 (Custom location with larger size)"

limitations:
  - "Page file configuration does NOT prove sensitive data exists in page files"
  - "Memory management settings don't indicate actual memory forensic evidence"
  - "Disabled page file clearing doesn't prove sensitive data was recovered"
  - "Virtual memory configuration may be for legitimate performance optimization"
  - "Page file size settings don't indicate actual memory usage or contents"
  - "Security settings may be configured for operational rather than forensic reasons"
