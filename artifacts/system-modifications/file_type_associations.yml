details:
  what: |
    Windows maintains comprehensive file type associations that determine which applications handle 
    specific file extensions, define shell actions (Open, Edit, Print), specify icon locations, 
    and set command line parameters for execution. Includes both system-wide associations and 
    user-specific overrides.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for understanding file execution methods and potential malware persistence mechanisms. 
    Shows how files are launched, can reveal hijacked file associations used by malware for persistence, 
    and indicates unauthorized changes to default programs. Essential for analyzing execution paths 
    and identifying security compromises.

  structure: |
    File extensions stored as registry keys (.exe, .txt, .pdf) pointing to ProgID class identifiers. 
    ProgID classes contain shell command definitions, icon paths, application details, and supported 
    actions. Default values specify handling applications, with shell\\open\\command containing 
    execution strings.

  examples:
    - ".exe\\(Default): exefile (Executable file type identifier)"
    - "exefile\\shell\\open\\command: \"%1\" %* (Direct execution)"
    - ".txt\\(Default): txtfile (Text file identifier)"
    - "txtfile\\shell\\open\\command: %SystemRoot%\\system32\\NOTEPAD.EXE %1"
    - ".pdf\\(Default): AcroExch.Document (Adobe Acrobat association)"
    - "Hijacked Association: .txt\\shell\\open\\command: C:\\malware\\backdoor.exe %1"
    - ".lnk\\(Default): lnkfile (Shortcut file handler)"
    - "Unknown\\shell\\open\\command: %SystemRoot%\\system32\\rundll32.exe"

limitations:
  - "File association configuration does NOT prove malicious file execution occurred"
  - "Hijacked associations don't indicate successful exploitation or persistence"
  - "Association modifications may be legitimate software installation changes"
  - "Default program settings don't prove files were actually opened"
  - "Shell command modifications may be for legitimate application upgrades"
  - "ProgID changes don't indicate malicious activity was successful"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_hijacking_proof:
    - "Process execution logs showing malicious applications launched via hijacked associations"
    - "File system artifacts showing malicious files executed through association abuse"
    - "Event logs showing successful execution of hijacked file handlers"
    - "Registry changes showing association modifications during attack timeframes"
    - "Application logs showing unexpected programs handling specific file types"

    - "File modifications showing malicious applications installed during association changes"
    - "Event logs showing file operations triggering hijacked associations"
    - "Registry changes in related startup locations during file association modifications"
    - "Process execution showing persistence achieved through association abuse"
