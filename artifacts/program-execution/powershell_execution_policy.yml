details:
  what: |
    PowerShell execution policy settings control script execution permissions, logging configuration, 
    transcription settings, module loading policies, and security restrictions. Determines security 
    restrictions, audit capabilities, and execution environments across different user contexts.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows if PowerShell security was weakened to allow malicious script execution, reveals logging 
    configuration that may hide or expose malicious activity, and indicates PowerShell usage patterns. 
    Critical for analyzing script-based attacks, PowerShell Empire usage, and advanced persistent 
    threats using PowerShell for persistence and lateral movement.

  structure: |
    ExecutionPolicy values control script execution (Restricted, AllSigned, RemoteSigned, Unrestricted, Bypass), 
    logging settings for ScriptBlock and Module logging, transcription paths, constrained language mode settings, 
    and AMSI bypass attempts stored as REG_SZ and REG_DWORD values with policy inheritance hierarchies.

  examples:
    - "ExecutionPolicy: Unrestricted (allows all scripts)"
    - "EnableScriptBlockLogging: 1 (detailed script logging enabled)"
    - "EnableTranscripting: 1 (session transcription enabled)"
    - "OutputDirectory: C:\\Logs\\PowerShell_Transcripts"
    - "EnableModuleLogging: 1 (module activity logging)"
    - "ModuleNames: * (log all modules)"
    - "ConstrainedLanguageMode: 0 (full language mode)"
    - "ScriptBlockInvocationLogging: 1 (detailed invocation logging)"
    - "EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging: 1"
    - "PSVersion: 5.1.19041.1682"

limitations:
  - "Execution policy settings do NOT prevent script execution - can be bypassed with command-line parameters"
  - "Policy changes don't indicate what scripts were actually executed"
  - "Logging configuration may be disabled after malicious activity"
  - "PowerShell can be launched with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass parameter"
  - "Constrained Language Mode can be bypassed with various techniques"
  - "AMSI bypass methods can disable security monitoring"
  - "Transcription logs may be deleted or corrupted by attackers"
  - "Module logging settings don't capture all PowerShell activity"
