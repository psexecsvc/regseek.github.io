details:
  what: |
    Windows UserAssist tracks program execution statistics for GUI applications accessed through 
    Windows Explorer, desktop, and Start menu. Stores execution count, last run time, session data, 
    and focus time encoded with ROT13 obfuscation. Different GUIDs track different application categories.

  forensic_value: |
    Provides detailed execution statistics showing how many times programs were run and when they 
    were last executed. Critical for establishing user behavior patterns, program usage frequency, 
    and timeline analysis of application execution. Can prove user interaction with specific applications 
    and reveal usage of portable/malicious tools.

  structure: |
    ROT13-encoded executable paths as value names with binary data containing execution count, 
    last run time (FILETIME), session ID, and focus time. Multiple subkeys for different program 
    categories and Windows versions. Data structure varies between Windows versions with consistent core elements.

  examples:
    - "Encoded: HRZR_PGYFRFFVAT\\{CEBTENF}\\Count"
    - "Decoded: UEME_CTLSESSION\\{PROGRAMS}\\Count"
    - "Program: notepad.exe"
    - "Run Count: 15"
    - "Last Executed: 2024-01-15 14:30:25"
    - "Focus Time: 120000ms"
    - "Session ID: 2"
    - "ROT13 Example: abgrCnq.rkr -> notepad.exe"

limitations:
  - "UserAssist only tracks GUI applications launched through Windows Explorer shell"
  - "Command-line executed programs do not appear in UserAssist"
  - "Programs launched via Run dialog, batch files, or scripts may not be tracked"
  - "Portable applications on removable media may not create persistent entries"
  - "UserAssist can be disabled through registry modification or Group Policy"
  - "Data corruption can occur causing inaccurate counts or timestamps"
  - "Focus time calculations may be unreliable on systems with multiple monitors"
  - "Administrative privileges may be required to access other users' UserAssist data"
