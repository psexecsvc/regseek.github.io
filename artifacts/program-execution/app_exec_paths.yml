description: "Registered application paths for command-line execution without full path specification"

paths:
  - "HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths"
  - "HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths"

details:
  what: |
    Windows registry entries allowing applications to be executed from command line, 
    Run dialog, or Start menu search without specifying full paths. Contains default 
    executable paths, working directories, and PATH environment additions for registered applications.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows applications registered for easy execution and can reveal malware that registers 
    itself for convenient access. Useful for understanding available execution vectors, 
    identifying malicious applications that register for easy access, and tracking software installations.

  structure: |
    Application names as subkeys with default value pointing to full executable path. 
    Optional Path value specifies additional directories. DropTarget value indicates 
    drag-and-drop support. Values stored as REG_SZ with optional REG_EXPAND_SZ.

  examples:
    - "notepad.exe\\(Default): C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe"
    - "chrome.exe\\(Default): C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\chrome.exe"
    - "chrome.exe\\Path: C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome"
    - "malware.exe\\(Default): C:\\Temp\\malware.exe"
    - "python.exe\\(Default): C:\\Python39\\python.exe"
    - "python.exe\\Path: C:\\Python39;C:\\Python39\\Scripts"
    - "suspicious_tool.exe\\(Default): C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\tool.exe"
    - "cmd\\(Default): C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"

limitations:
  - "App Paths registration does NOT prove application was executed"
  - "Path entries may be created by installers without user execution"
  - "Malicious entries may be mixed with legitimate application registrations"
  - "Registration enables convenient execution but doesn't indicate actual usage"
  - "Administrative privileges can create system-wide entries without user knowledge"
  - "Path registration may persist after application uninstallation"
  - "DropTarget settings don't indicate drag-and-drop operations occurred"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Process execution logs showing actual program launch via registered paths"
    - "Command-line history showing usage of registered application names"
    - "Event logs confirming successful program startup through App Paths"
    - "UserAssist entries showing user-initiated launches of registered applications"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "ShimCache or AmCache entries with matching executable paths"
    - "Recent documents created by applications launched via App Paths"
    - "File system artifacts showing application activity after launch"
