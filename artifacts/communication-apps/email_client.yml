details:
  what: |
    Email client configuration including default mail client registration, MAPI (Messaging
    Application Programming Interface) settings, account configuration remnants, and protocol
    associations. Controls email handling behavior and system-wide messaging functionality.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating email-based attacks and data exfiltration through email channels.
    Shows email client usage indicating potential corporate espionage, reveals mail client
    modifications that facilitate email interception, and provides evidence of email-based
    command and control communication.

  structure: |
    Mail client registration includes default client specification, protocol associations for
    mailto: links, MAPI provider configuration, and client-specific settings. MAPI configuration
    controls messaging API behavior and service provider integration.

  examples:
    - "Default Mail Client: Microsoft Outlook (Configured default email application)"
    - "mailto\\shell\\open\\command: \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\OUTLOOK.EXE\" -c IPM.Note /m \"%1\""
    - "MAPI\\CMC: 1 (Common Messaging Calls interface enabled)"
    - "MAPI\\CMCDLLNAME32: mapi32.dll (32-bit MAPI library)"
    - "Outlook\\Profiles\\Outlook: Default mail profile configuration"
    - "AutoConfigURL: https://autodiscover.company.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml"

limitations:
  - "Email client configuration does NOT prove emails were sent, received, or accessed"
  - "MAPI settings don't indicate actual messaging API usage or email operations"
  - "Default client registration doesn't show email application was actively used"
  - "Profile settings don't prove successful email account configuration or connectivity"
  - "AutoConfig URLs don't indicate successful email server autodiscovery"
  - "Mail client paths don't show application execution or email handling"
  - "Protocol associations don't prove mailto: links were actually used"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_usage_proof:
    - "Email client data files showing actual sent/received messages"
    - "Process execution logs showing email client application activity"
    - "Network traffic logs showing SMTP/IMAP/POP3 email protocol communications"
    - "Windows Event Logs showing email client startup and messaging activity"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents showing email-related files (PST, EML, MSG files)"
    - "Registry keys modified by email applications during message processing"
    - "File system artifacts showing email attachment downloads or saves"
