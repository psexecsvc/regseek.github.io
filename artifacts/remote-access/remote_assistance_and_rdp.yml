details:
  what: |
    Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Remote Assistance configuration including service enablement,
    port settings, authentication requirements, encryption levels, and session management.
    Controls terminal services behavior and remote assistance capabilities.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating unauthorized remote access and lateral movement techniques.
    Shows if remote access was enabled for malicious connections and reveals configuration
    changes that facilitate attacker persistence. Essential for detecting advanced persistent
    threats using legitimate remote access tools.

  structure: |
    Terminal Server settings include fDenyTSConnections (RDP enable/disable), PortNumber 
    (listening port), SecurityLayer (authentication method), UserAuthentication (Network 
    Level Authentication), and MaxInstanceCount (concurrent sessions). Remote Assistance 
    contains AllowToGetHelp and MaxTicketExpiry settings.

  examples:
    - "fDenyTSConnections: 0 (Remote Desktop enabled - potential security risk)"
    - "PortNumber: 3389 (Standard RDP port - commonly targeted)"
    - "PortNumber: 443 (Non-standard RDP port - potential evasion technique)"
    - "SecurityLayer: 2 (TLS 1.0 authentication required)"
    - "UserAuthentication: 1 (Network Level Authentication enabled)"
    - "AllowToGetHelp: 1 (Remote Assistance enabled)"
    - "MaxTicketExpiry: 6 (6-hour session timeout)"
    - "CreateEncryptedOnlyTickets: 1 (Require encryption for assistance)"

limitations:
  - "Configuration settings do NOT prove remote access actually occurred"
  - "Enabled RDP doesn't indicate successful connections or authentication"
  - "Port settings don't reveal actual network traffic or connection attempts"
  - "Remote assistance enablement doesn't prove assistance sessions were established"
  - "Settings can be changed by malware without user knowledge"
  - "Configuration doesn't indicate who accessed the system or when"
  - "Security settings may be overridden by group policy or local bypass"
