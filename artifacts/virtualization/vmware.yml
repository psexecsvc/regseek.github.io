details:
  what: |
    VMware Workstation and Player manage desktop virtualization including virtual
    machine creation, hardware configuration, network settings, and hypervisor
    management. Registry stores VM configurations, licensing information,
    performance settings, and virtual hardware preferences.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating virtual machine usage, potential evidence isolation,
    malware analysis environments, and sophisticated attack techniques using
    virtualization. Shows evidence of VM creation, configuration changes,
    and virtual network setups that could hide activities.

  structure: |
    VMware configuration includes virtual machine paths, hardware settings, network
    configurations, licensing data, and performance preferences. VM registry entries
    track virtual hardware assignments, snapshot locations, and isolation settings.

  examples:
    - "InstallPath: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VMware\\VMware Workstation"
    - "VMInventory: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\Virtual Machines"

    - "RecentVM1: C:\\VMs\\Malware_Sandbox.vmx"
    - "Networking.Host-Only: vmnet1 (Host-only network adapter)"
    - "VMware.Player.SharedFolders: 1 (Shared folders enabled)"
    - "Hardware.MemSize: 4096 (4GB RAM allocation)"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows configuration only, not actual VM usage or guest OS activity"
  - "Recent VM list doesn't prove virtual machines were actively used"
  - "Shared folder settings don't indicate actual file sharing occurred"
  - "VM inventory paths don't prove VMs were executed or contained malware"
  - "Malware sandbox VMs suggest analysis but don't prove malicious activity"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_conclusions:
    - "VMware log files showing actual VM operations"
    - "Virtual machine disk files (.vmdk, .vmx, .nvram)"
    - "Process execution logs showing vmware.exe activity"
    - "File system artifacts in VM storage directories"
    - "Network traffic logs showing VM communications"

    - "Timeline analysis of VM creation and configuration changes"
    - "User activity showing VMware application usage"
