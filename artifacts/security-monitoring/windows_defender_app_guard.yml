details:
  what: |
    Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) provides hardware-based isolation for Microsoft Edge 
    and Office applications using Hyper-V virtualization technology. Registry manages isolation 
    policies, virtualization settings, data persistence rules, and enterprise configuration.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating attempts to bypass enterprise security controls, reveals configuration 
    changes that could weaken isolation protections, and shows evidence of sophisticated attacks 
    targeting virtualized environments. Can reveal attempts to disable security features.

  structure: |
    WindowsApplicationGuard contains feature enablement settings, isolation policies, and data 
    persistence configuration. AppHVSI policy entries control enterprise settings for clipboard 
    access, file downloads, printing, and camera/microphone usage within isolated environments.

  examples:
    - "Enabled: 1 (Application Guard enabled)"
    - "AllowPersistence: 0 (Non-persistent mode - data deleted on restart)"
    - "AllowClipboard: 1 (Clipboard access between host and container allowed)"
    - "BlockNonEnterpriseContent: 1 (Block non-enterprise websites)"
    - "CertificateThumbprints: Enterprise certificate validation"
    - "SaveFilesToHost: 0 (File downloads to container only)"

limitations:
  - "Application Guard configuration does NOT prove isolation bypass occurred"
  - "Policy settings don't indicate successful security feature circumvention"
  - "Configuration changes may be legitimate enterprise security adjustments"
  - "Isolation settings don't prove malicious activity within containerized environments"
  - "Virtualization configuration doesn't indicate actual threat protection effectiveness"
  - "Enterprise policies may be modified for operational rather than malicious purposes"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_bypass_proof:
    - "Event logs showing successful isolation container escapes"
    - "Process execution logs showing unauthorized access to host system from container"
    - "Network traffic logs showing unauthorized communication from isolated environment"
    - "File system artifacts showing data exfiltration from containerized applications"
    - "Registry changes showing Application Guard policy modifications during attacks"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Browser logs showing attempts to access restricted content during isolation"
    - "Hyper-V event logs showing container creation and modification events"
    - "File system access logs showing unauthorized file operations in isolation mode"
    - "Network logs showing communication attempts blocked by Application Guard"
