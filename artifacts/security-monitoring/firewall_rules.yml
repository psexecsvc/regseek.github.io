details:
  what: |
    Windows firewall configuration including enabled/disabled status, firewall rules, port exceptions, 
    application exceptions, and network profile settings for Domain, Private, and Public networks. 
    Controls inbound and outbound traffic filtering and application permissions.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows security posture changes, unauthorized firewall rule modifications, malware attempts to 
    create network exceptions, and evidence of network policy tampering. Critical for understanding 
    network security state, identifying firewall bypass attempts, and revealing unauthorized network access permissions.

  structure: |
    Profile-based configuration with subkeys for DomainProfile, StandardProfile (Private), and PublicProfile 
    containing EnableFirewall, DefaultInboundAction, DefaultOutboundAction, and detailed rule definitions. 
    Binary data includes rule specifications, port ranges, and application paths.

  examples:
    - "DomainProfile\\EnableFirewall: 1 (firewall enabled)"
    - "StandardProfile\\DefaultInboundAction: 1 (block inbound)"
    - "PublicProfile\\DefaultOutboundAction: 0 (allow outbound)"
    - "FirewallRules\\Rule: v2.10|Action=Allow|Active=TRUE|Dir=In|Protocol=6|LPort=80|App=C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\app.exe|"
    - "Exception: Allow TCP 3389 for Remote Desktop"
    - "Malicious: Allow TCP 4444 for C:\\malware\\backdoor.exe"
    - "GloballyOpenPorts: 445:TCP:*:Enabled:File and Printer Sharing"
    - "AuthorizedApplications: C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe:*:Enabled:Generic Host Process"

limitations:
  - "Firewall rule configuration does NOT prove network traffic actually occurred"
  - "Rule exceptions don't indicate applications successfully communicated through firewall"
  - "Disabled firewall settings don't prove network attacks were successful"
  - "Port exceptions may be legitimate system requirements, not malicious activity"
  - "Application exceptions may be created by legitimate software installations"
  - "Rule modifications may be administrative changes, not evidence tampering"
  - "Default actions don't show specific traffic that was blocked or allowed"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Network traffic logs showing actual connections matching firewall rule criteria"
    - "Windows Firewall service logs showing rule enforcement and traffic decisions"
    - "Application logs showing successful network communication through firewall"
    - "Event logs showing firewall rule changes and policy updates"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Process execution logs showing applications that created firewall exceptions"
    - "Timeline analysis correlating rule changes with suspicious network activity"
    - "System configuration changes logs showing administrative firewall modifications"
