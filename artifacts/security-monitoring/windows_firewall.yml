details:
  what: |
    Windows Firewall Advanced Rules manage granular network traffic control including application-specific 
    permissions, port exceptions, protocol filtering, and profile-based security policies. Registry 
    stores detailed rule configurations and inbound/outbound traffic permissions.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating network-based attacks, unauthorized network access, and malware 
    communication attempts. Shows evidence of firewall rule modifications that could enable data 
    exfiltration, reveals custom exceptions that bypass security, and indicates sophisticated attacks.

  structure: |
    FirewallRules contain pipe-delimited rule definitions including direction (In/Out), action 
    (Allow/Block), protocol, local/remote ports, application paths, and profiles. Profile-specific 
    configurations control firewall behavior for domain, private, and public networks.

  examples:
    - "Rule: v2.25|Action=Allow|Active=TRUE|Dir=In|Protocol=6|LPort=80|App=C:\\Program Files\\App\\app.exe"
    - "Rule: v2.25|Action=Block|Active=TRUE|Dir=Out|Protocol=17|RPort=53|RA=8.8.8.8"
    - "DomainProfile\\EnableFirewall: 1 (Domain firewall enabled)"
    - "PublicProfile\\EnableFirewall: 0 (Public firewall disabled - risk)"
    - "StandardProfile\\DefaultInboundAction: 1 (Block inbound by default)"
    - "FirewallRules\\{GUID}: Malware exception rule (Suspicious custom rule)"

limitations:
  - "Firewall rules do NOT prove network communication actually occurred"
  - "Exception rules don't indicate successful data transmission or exfiltration"
  - "Rule modifications may be legitimate network configuration changes"
  - "Application permissions don't prove malicious network activity happened"
  - "Disabled firewall settings don't prove unauthorized network access occurred"
  - "Port exceptions may be required for legitimate business applications"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_communication_proof:
    - "Network traffic logs showing actual data transmission through firewall exceptions"
    - "Event logs showing successful network connections using allowed rules"
    - "Process execution logs showing applications utilizing firewall permissions"
    - "File system artifacts showing data received or transmitted through firewall rules"
    - "Application logs showing successful network operations through configured exceptions"
