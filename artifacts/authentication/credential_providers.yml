details:
  what: |
    Credential Providers extend Windows authentication infrastructure with custom logon methods, 
    smart card integration, biometric authentication, multi-factor authentication, and enterprise 
    single sign-on solutions. Registry manages provider registration and authentication filters.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for detecting unauthorized authentication modifications, malicious credential harvesting 
    tools, and sophisticated attack techniques targeting authentication infrastructure. Shows evidence 
    of credential provider abuse for password interception and authentication bypass attempts.

  structure: |
    Credential Providers registry contains CLSID-based entries referencing COM objects that implement 
    authentication interfaces. Each provider includes DLL paths, capability flags, trust levels, and 
    configuration parameters. Provider Filters control authentication flow.

  examples:
    - "Credential Providers\\\\{60b78e88-ead8-445c-9cfd-0b87f74ea6cd}: Password Credential Provider"
    - "Credential Providers\\\\{cb82ea12-9f71-446d-8757-b4a77dd20b9f}: Smart Card Provider"
    - "Credential Providers\\\\{8AF662BF-65A0-4D0A-A540-A338A999D36F}: Biometric Provider"
    - "Malicious Provider\\\\{12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc}: C:\\\\malware\\\\cred_stealer.dll"
    - "Provider Filters\\\\{GUID}: Authentication flow control filter"
    - "PLAP Providers\\\\{GUID}: Pre-logon network access provider"
    - "Capability Flags: 0x00000001 (Primary credential provider)"
    - "Trust Level: 0x00020000 (High trust authentication component)"

limitations:
  - "Credential provider registration does NOT prove malicious credential harvesting occurred"
  - "Provider installation may be legitimate enterprise authentication enhancement"
  - "Custom providers don't indicate successful password interception"
  - "Authentication filter modifications may be for legitimate security improvements"
  - "Provider capability flags don't prove actual authentication usage"
  - "DLL registration doesn't indicate active credential collection"
