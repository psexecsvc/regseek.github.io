details:
  what: |
    Windows Security Center provides centralized monitoring and reporting of security status
    including firewall, antivirus, anti-spyware, and update status. Manages security provider
    registration, user notification settings, security status aggregation, and health monitoring
    for comprehensive system security oversight. Controls security warning displays and
    provider integration for enterprise and standalone systems.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for identifying attempts to hide security status from users, reveals disabled
    security notifications that may indicate compromise, shows registered security providers
    that could be malicious software, and indicates security policy modifications designed
    to suppress security warnings. Attackers often disable Security Center notifications
    to prevent users from discovering security software disabling or malware presence.

  structure: |
    Security Center configuration includes monitoring settings for individual security
    categories, provider registration data with capabilities and status information,
    notification policies, and user interface control settings. Provider information
    stored with GUIDs, product names, and security service capabilities including
    antivirus, firewall, and anti-spyware functionality definitions.

  examples:
    - "SecurityCenter\\DisableNotifications: 1 (All notifications suppressed)"
    - "AntiVirusDisableNotify: 1 (Antivirus warnings disabled)"
    - "FirewallDisableNotify: 1 (Firewall notifications disabled)"
    - "UpdatesDisableNotify: 1 (Update notifications suppressed)"
    - "AntiVirusOverride: 1 (Security Center antivirus monitoring overridden)"
    - "HealthService\\HealthCheckSettings: [Binary configuration data]"
    - "Monitoring\\{GUID}: Security provider registration entry"
    - "UacDisableNotify: 1 (UAC notifications disabled)"
