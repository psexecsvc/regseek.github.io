details:
  what: |
    Windows print system configuration including print processors, print monitors, print providers,
    and printer-specific settings. These DLLs are loaded by the spooler service (spoolsv.exe) and
    provide opportunities for persistent code execution with SYSTEM privileges. Controls print job
    processing, printer communication, and network printing functionality.

  forensic_value: |
    Advanced persistence technique where malware registers malicious DLLs as print processors,
    monitors, or providers. Shows unauthorized print system modifications that can provide persistent
    access with high privileges. Can indicate sophisticated attacks targeting the print spooler
    service for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or persistent access to critical systems.

  structure: |
    Print processors and monitors registered with DLL paths, entry points, and configuration data.
    Each entry specifies the DLL location, functionality provided, environment (Windows/NT x86/x64),
    and load order. Print providers handle network printing, authentication, and print queue
    management with specific capabilities.

  examples:
    - "Processors\\winprint\\Driver: C:\\Windows\\System32\\winprint.dll"
    - "Processors\\malicious\\Driver: C:\\malware\\evil_processor.dll"
    - "Monitors\\Standard TCP/IP Port\\Driver: tcpmon.dll"
    - "Monitors\\Backdoor Monitor\\Driver: C:\\temp\\backdoor.dll"
    - "Providers\\LanMan Print Services\\Name: win32spl.dll"
    - "Providers\\Malicious Provider\\Name: C:\\malware\\provider.dll"
    - "PrinterDriverDir: C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers"
    - "Environment: Windows NT x86"

limitations:
  - "Print system configuration does NOT prove DLLs were loaded or executed"
  - "Registered processors don't indicate print jobs were processed through malicious code"
  - "Monitor registrations don't show printer communication was intercepted"
  - "Provider entries don't prove network printing services were compromised"
  - "Print spooler may not load registered DLLs due to service issues or restrictions"
  - "Malicious print components may fail due to missing dependencies or permissions"
  - "Configuration doesn't reveal frequency or success of print-based persistence"
