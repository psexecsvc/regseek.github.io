details:
  what: |
    Windows Task Scheduler maintains registry entries for all scheduled tasks, including task
    metadata, execution history, hierarchical organization, and trigger information. Tracks both
    system tasks and user-created automation with detailed execution statistics, security contexts,
    and scheduling patterns. Registry data complements XML task definitions.

  forensic_value: |
    Scheduled tasks are a common persistence mechanism for malware and legitimate automation.
    Shows task creation times, execution patterns, authors, and can reveal malicious automation,
    unauthorized access schedules, or privilege escalation attempts. Critical for identifying
    advanced persistent threats (APTs) that use legitimate Windows scheduling for persistence.

  structure: |
    Tasks subkey contains binary task metadata including Author, Date, Path, URI, Actions, and
    execution history. Tree subkey maintains hierarchical task organization with folder structures.
    Binary data includes GUID identifiers, security descriptors, trigger definitions, and
    execution statistics in proprietary Microsoft format.

  examples:
    - "Author: Microsoft Corporation"
    - "Path: \\Microsoft\\Windows\\UpdateOrchestrator\\Schedule Scan"
    - "URI: \\MaliciousTask"
    - "Date: 2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
    - "Actions: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c malicious_script.bat"
    - "Triggers: Daily at 3:00 AM"
    - "Security Context: SYSTEM"
    - "Last Run: 2024-01-20 03:00:15"
    - "Next Run: 2024-01-21 03:00:00"
    - "Run Count: 47"

limitations:
  - "Scheduled task registry entries do NOT prove tasks were executed"
  - "Task metadata doesn't indicate successful task completion or failure"
  - "Execution history may not reflect actual program execution or results"
  - "Task scheduling doesn't prove scheduled programs were found or functional"
  - "Registry entries don't show task output, errors, or runtime behavior"
  - "Task triggers don't indicate trigger conditions were met or actions taken"
  - "Security context doesn't prove tasks ran with specified privileges"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Task Scheduler event logs showing actual task execution (Event ID 100, 101)"
    - "Process execution logs showing scheduled programs launching"
    - "File system artifacts showing task output, logs, or modified files"
    - "Windows Event Logs showing process creation from Task Scheduler service"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Registry modifications made by executed scheduled tasks"
    - "Network traffic initiated by scheduled programs"
    - "File system changes indicating scheduled task activity"
    - "Application event logs showing scheduled program execution"
