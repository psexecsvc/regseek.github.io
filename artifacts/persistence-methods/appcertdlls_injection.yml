details:
  what: |
    AppCertDLLs registry key enables system-wide DLL injection by specifying Dynamic Link Libraries
    that Windows automatically loads into every process that calls CreateProcess, CreateProcessAsUser,
    CreateProcessWithLogonW, CreateProcessWithTokenW, and WinExec APIs. Originally designed for
    application certification and compatibility testing.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical persistence mechanism used by advanced malware and sophisticated attackers for system-wide
    code injection. Shows evidence of persistent DLL injection affecting all processes, rootkit-like
    behavior, and advanced evasion techniques. Provides unrestricted access to all process memory
    spaces and can be used for credential theft and comprehensive system compromise.

  structure: |
    Registry key contains value names as arbitrary identifiers with REG_SZ data specifying full
    paths to DLL files. Each DLL listed will be automatically injected into every new process
    created on the system. Multiple DLLs can be specified with different value names. Empty
    or non-existent key is normal state.

  examples:
    - "CertificationDLL1: C:\\Windows\\System32\\legitimate_cert.dll (Legitimate certification DLL)"
    - "MaliciousDLL: C:\\malware\\backdoor.dll (Suspicious DLL injection)"
    - "RootkitDLL: C:\\Windows\\System32\\evil_rootkit.dll (Rootkit persistence)"
    - "SpywareDLL: C:\\temp\\keylogger.dll (Keylogging DLL injection)"
    - "Empty Key: (Normal state - no DLL injection configured)"

limitations:
  - "AppCertDLLs entries do NOT prove DLLs were successfully loaded or executed"
  - "Registry configuration doesn't indicate successful process injection occurred"
  - "DLL paths don't show malicious payloads were delivered or activated"
  - "Persistence mechanism may be disabled by security software or policies"
  - "DLL injection may fail due to missing files, permission issues, or compatibility problems"
  - "Configuration doesn't reveal frequency or duration of malicious activity"
  - "Registry entries don't prove system compromise or successful exploitation"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_injection_proof:
    - "Process execution logs showing DLL loading into target processes"
    - "File system artifacts showing malicious DLL files at specified paths"
    - "Memory dumps showing injected DLL code in process address spaces"
    - "Network traffic logs showing command and control communications from injected processes"

    - "EDR logs showing suspicious process behavior after DLL injection"
    - "Registry modifications made by injected DLL code"
    - "File system changes indicating malicious DLL activity"
    - "Event logs showing process creation and DLL loading events"
