details:
  what: |
    Windows shell extensions provide integration points for third-party applications to extend
    Explorer functionality through context menu handlers, property sheet handlers, icon overlay
    handlers, drag-and-drop handlers, and shell namespace extensions. These COM-based extensions
    execute within Explorer.exe process and provide rich integration with Windows shell operations.

  forensic_value: |
    Malware often uses shell extensions for persistence and to intercept file operations, monitor
    user activity, or provide covert access points. Shows unauthorized context menu additions,
    suspicious file handlers, and potential execution points triggered by normal user file
    interactions. Can indicate sophisticated malware that integrates deeply with Windows shell.

  structure: |
    CLSID identifiers as values pointing to registered shell extension components with specific
    handler types. Context menu handlers organized by file types, locations (files, directories,
    drives), and shell objects. Approved extensions list shows which extensions are permitted
    to load in Explorer process.

limitations:
  - "Shell extension registration does NOT prove extensions were loaded or executed"
  - "Context menu handler entries don't indicate menu interactions occurred"
  - "Approved extension listings don't show extensions were actively used"
  - "CLSID references don't prove successful COM object instantiation"
  - "Shell extension loading may be blocked by security policies or restrictions"
  - "Malicious extensions may fail due to missing dependencies or permission issues"
  - "Registry entries don't reveal frequency or success of shell extension activation"
